science,t57qgq,"Study suggests eating salmon-feed fish, instead of farmed salmon. Commercial salmon feed contains fish oil and fish meal, which are obtained from wild-caught fish like sardines and anchovies. According to new research, it would be ecologically better if we just ate those feed fish ourselves.",MistWeaver80,2022-03-02 12:15:12,https://reddit.com/r/science/comments/t57qgq/study_suggests_eating_salmonfeed_fish_instead_of/,,apitoon fish meal,"fish meal, fish oil",4800,579,71.57777777777778

environment,10qp5p2,Entocycle grows larvae as a sustainable alternative to soybeans and fishmeal for animal feed. They invented a fully integrated climate control system to monitor and optimize the growth of larvae in insect farms. This could reduce soybean production and deforestation.,Dalembert,2023-02-01 02:21:50,https://reddit.com/r/environment/comments/10qp5p2/entocycle_grows_larvae_as_a_sustainable/,,ambitious fishmeal product,fishmeal,12,2,44.59111111111111
science,r3hmya,"Production costs of protein feed for farmed fish using methanotrophic microbes and methane from U.S. wastewater treatment plants, landfills and oil/gas facilities are lower than the current cost of fishmeal. With 20% cost reductions, stranded methane from the U.S. can satisfy global fishmeal demand.",Litvi,2021-11-27 09:58:19,https://reddit.com/r/science/comments/r3hmya/production_costs_of_protein_feed_for_farmed_fish/,,ambitious fishmeal product,fishmeal,74,4,43.08222222222223
