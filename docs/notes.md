Overall Structure & Readability
Modular Design: Your code is neatly organized into functions and classes. This modularity is great for maintainability.

Documentation: You’ve added docstrings for most functions, which improves clarity. However, consider adding inline comments in complex logic blocks (like deduplication and similarity scoring) for future developers.

Environment Variable Handling
Validation: The function validate_env_vars() is defined to check for required environment variables, which is a solid practice. However, it isn’t called anywhere. To ensure your application fails fast if required variables are missing, call it early in your main() function.

Order of Definitions: You reference REDDIT_CLIENT_ID and REDDIT_CLIENT_SECRET in validate_env_vars() before those globals are defined. Rearranging the code to define these constants first or modifying the validation to fetch variables within the function can avoid potential issues.

External Dependencies & Imports
Missing Imports:

The asyncio module is used in AdaptiveRateLimiter.wait() (via await asyncio.sleep(wait_time)) and in search_subreddits() (via asyncio.run(...)), but it’s not imported. Adding import asyncio is necessary.

The function batch_search_terms(filtered_terms) is called in search_subreddits() but isn’t defined anywhere. This could break the execution unless it’s defined in another module.

Redundant Imports:

You import SequenceMatcher from difflib but never use it. Since you have your own quick_similarity() function, consider removing the unused import.

Caching & State Management
DiskCache & SearchState:

Your implementation for persistent disk caching and resumable search state is robust and demonstrates good fault tolerance (e.g., error handling during load/save).

Using MD5 for cache keys is acceptable, though be aware of MD5’s limitations if security were a concern (not likely here).

Search & Deduplication Logic
Preprocessing & Deduplication:

Your approach in preprocess_search_terms() and clean_search_terms() is sound. The use of a custom similarity function (with a higher threshold) is a neat trick to group similar search terms.

Ensure that the similarity threshold and batch sizes are tuned appropriately for your dataset, as performance might vary.

Relevance Scoring:

The function deduplicate_and_score_results() uses a weighted scoring system. This is effective but consider encapsulating the scoring weights in configuration variables for easier tuning later.

Error Handling & Logging
Logging:

You’re using logging extensively, which is excellent for monitoring long-running search processes. The periodic progress updates and file logging in main() enhance debuggability.

When logging exceptions, ensure sensitive data is not inadvertently logged.

Graceful Failure:

The use of try/except blocks throughout, especially in file I/O and network calls, helps ensure the process fails gracefully.

The final cleanup of logger handlers is a nice touch.

Asynchronous Code & Rate Limiting
AdaptiveRateLimiter:

The concept is solid: dynamically adjusting the request rate based on success and failure counts. Just remember to import asyncio and verify that your asynchronous code paths (like batch_search_terms) are fully implemented.

Rate Limiting:

The rate limiter is an innovative idea, but make sure its adjustment logic (every 60 seconds) aligns well with the expected request volume in production.

Integration with PRAW (Reddit API)
RedditSearcher:

Your use of PRAW for interacting with Reddit is standard. The multiple search queries per term enhance coverage.

Consider adding more specific error handling around network issues (e.g., retrying failed requests) if you expect intermittent connectivity issues.

Minor Improvements & Recommendations
Function Call Order:

Call validate_env_vars() early in main() to catch configuration issues immediately.

Code Consistency:

Maintain consistency in naming (e.g., sometimes you use terms, other times search_terms) to avoid confusion.

Testing & Edge Cases:

Ensure your functions handle edge cases gracefully, such as empty DataFrames or network timeouts.

Missing Definitions:

Address the undefined batch_search_terms() to avoid runtime errors. If it’s part of a larger framework, document its expected behavior clearly.
